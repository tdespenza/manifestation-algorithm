**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**Status:** Active

## 1. What Is It?

**Manifestation Algorithm** is a privacy-first, offline desktop app that helps individuals
quantify and track their personal alignment across 40 life categories through a structured
10-point self-assessment questionnaire.

The app produces a single **Manifestation Score** (0 – 10,000 points) that serves as an
objective, repeatable measure of a user's overall alignment with their chosen principles
and practices. Over time, the score history shows whether a person is improving, plateauing,
or declining across the full breadth of their self-development work.

**Platform:** macOS, Windows, Linux _(Tauri 2 desktop app — no cloud, no account)_

## 2. The Problem It Solves

| Pain Point | Existing Solutions | Our Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Tracking apps are narrow (sleep OR fitness OR journaling) | Siloed single-category apps | One score across 40 categories |
| Cloud-first apps require trusting a company with private data | Notion, Airtable, Superhuman | SQLite on-device, zero telemetry |
| "Score" systems are opaque or gamified | Duolingo streaks, mood apps | Transparent weighted formula, fully documented |
| No tool maps to manifestation / alignment frameworks | Generic productivity trackers | Purpose-built 40-category schema |

## 3. Target Users

### Primary — The Intentional Practitioner
- **Profile:** High-tech-comfort, 28–45, deeply invested in personal development
- **Frequency:** Weekly assessment (Sunday morning ritual)
- **Core need:** A single honest number that reflects total alignment, not just one area
- **Privacy:** Strongly prefers local-only; willing to opt into anonymous P2P benchmarking

### Secondary — The Curious Newcomer
- **Profile:** Medium-tech-comfort, 22–35, new to structured self-assessment
- **Frequency:** Infrequent initially, growing with familiarity
- **Core need:** Low-friction entry; ability to submit with partial answers
- **Privacy:** Appreciates default privacy; may not understand the P2P feature yet

_See `/docs/user-personas.md` for full persona detail._

## 4. Scoring Model

The **Manifestation Score** is calculated as:

$$\text{Total Score} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{MaxPoints}_i \times \frac{\text{UserRating}_i}{10}$$

- **40 categories** mapped to leaf questions, each weighted by maximum point value
- **Max score: 10,000 points**
- **Scale:** 1–10 per question (user-chosen; no answer defaults to 1 on submit)
- **Score tiers:** Excellent (> 7,000) · Good (4,000–7,000) · Needs Work (< 4,000)

_See `/docs/scoring-formula.md` for full specification._  
_See `ADR-006` for the decision to default unanswered questions to 1._

## 8. v1.0 Definition

v1.0 is declared "done" when:
1. First-run onboarding explains the scoring model before first submit
2. Post-submission category recommendations are displayed on the Dashboard
3. The tauri updater pubkey is replaced with a valid signing key
4. All P0 and P1 issues from the multi-agent review are closed

---

## 9. Key Constraints

- **No network writes without explicit user opt-in** — the P2P sharing toggle defaults to off
- **All personal data stays on disk** — no analytics, no crash reporting to external servers
- **The scoring formula is transparent** — fully open-source; no hidden weighting
- **Must run offline** — all features except P2P ranking work without internet
